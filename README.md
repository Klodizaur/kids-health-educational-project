### KidsHealth: Educational Website Project

This is an educational website I created during college in 2020.

### Overview

I was responsible for planning, designing, creating storyboards, and developing the website. 
The project required adhering to specific guidelines and requirements set by the course,
ensuring that the website was both educational and user-friendly. 

The primary goal of this project was to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills while working in a project-like environment, 
which included creating a planning calendar and managing the project timeline.
